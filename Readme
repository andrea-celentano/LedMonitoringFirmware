* HPS version 1.3 (September 11th 2014) 
** Major bug fixes
** (yet) untested feature: SCAN mode

* FT version 1.7 (September 11th 2014) 
** Major bug fixes
** (yet) untested feature: SCAN mode

* HPS version 1.2 (July 2nd 2014) 
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/hps.1.2.hex here]
** Added the following commands to set a sequence without using a TFTP server:
*** SET N_SEQUENCE_REPETITIONS
*** SET N_SEQUENCE_STEPS
*** SET SEQUENCE_STEP
*** SET SEQUENCE_DONE
** These commands are for experts only, therefore minimal consistency checks are implemented.

* FT version 1.6
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/hps.1.6.hex here]
** Same modifications as HPS version 1.2

* FT version 1.6

** Same modifications as HPS version 1.2





* HPS version 1.1 (July 2nd 2014) 
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/hps.1.1.hex here]
** Added "GET FIRMWARE" function to print firmware release loaded on the board
** '''Major improvement''': when a new firmware is loaded in the system, is not necessary any more to push button 0 to load default settings (ip/..). The system will do so automatically and will then reboot

* FT version 1.5
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/hps.1.5.hex here]
** Same modifications as HPS version 1.1

* HPS version 1.0 (June 26th 2014)
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/hps.1.0.hex here]

* Version 1.4.1 (April 29th 2014)
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/ftcal.1.4.1.hex here]
** Mainly bug fixes.

* Version 1.4 (April 28th 2014)
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/ftcal.1.4.hex here]
** The SET commands do no return anything now, if the command was issued properly. The errors are still issued.
** Added the "GET WIDTH_ALL" and "GET AMPL_ALL" commands
** Added the "GET LED_STATUS" command
** Added the "GET LED_STATUS_ALL" command
** Added the "SET DATA" command
** Added the "GET IP", "GET NETMASK", "GET GATEWAY",  "GET DATA_SERVER_IP", "GET DATA_FILE_NAME", "GET SEQUENCE_FILE_NAME" commands

* Version 1.3 (March 18th 2014)
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/ftcal.1.3.hex here]
** Now all the strings returned by the controller end with '\n'
** After a GET FREQ command, the frequency is returned in Hz for all values

* Version 1.2 (February 12th 2014)
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/ftcal.1.2.hex here]
** Minor fixes to the code, to optimize the number of I2C transactions.

* Version 1.1 (February 11th 2014)
** [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/ftcal.1.1.hex here]
** Implemented a "pause" in a sequence: if there is only one LED ID in any step, with ID "-1", then during that step NO LEDs are pulsed. However, the time relative to that step is used to define how long this pause is.
*** If there are more than one LED, a "-1" is ignored. If all LEDs are "-1", the step is a pause.
** Corrected a problem in the "TURN OFF"
** Corrected a problem in the "STOP_SEQUENCE", when the sequence is the DC one (i.e. a "START_SEQUENCE DC") was invoked.
** Corrected a problem in the "START_SEQUENCE DC": if the user starts a DC sequence, previously the "main" sequence, loaded trough the "LOAD_SEQUENCE" command from the TFTP server, was overloaded. Now this does not happen any more.

* Version 1.0 (January 1st 2014)
** First public release [http://www.ge.infn.it/~celentan/firmware/ftcal.1.0.hex here]
